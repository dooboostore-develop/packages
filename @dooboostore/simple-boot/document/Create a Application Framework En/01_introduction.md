# Preamble: Why Do We Create an Application Framework?

In software development, frameworks are powerful tools that reduce complexity and increase productivity. However, in a world where countless frameworks already exist, the question, "Why create another application framework?" is a natural one. This book goes beyond simply introducing a new framework; it aims to provide an in-depth exploration of the process of **how a framework is designed and implemented**.

The framework we will build and dissect is `@dooboostore/simple-boot`. This framework provides the following core features:

-   **Dependency Injection (DI):** Loosens the coupling between objects to enhance code reusability and testability.
-   **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** Manages cross-cutting concerns—such as logging, security, and transactions—that span multiple modules by modularizing them.
-   **A flexible router system:** Controls the application's flow and executes modules or methods based on specific paths.
-   **An Intent-based event system:** Enables communication between loosely coupled components.
-   **Method-level caching:** Optimizes the performance of repetitive operations.
-   **Data validation:** Ensures data integrity.

The goal of this book is to help you, the reader, understand the internal workings of `@dooboostore/simple-boot` and, furthermore, to gain the insight needed to design and implement your own framework. We will start from scratch, examining step-by-step why each feature is necessary and how it is implemented.

## Key Topics Covered in This Book

-   **Core Management System:** The DI container and object lifecycle management.
-   **Handling Cross-cutting Concerns:** Separating common logic and handling exceptions through AOP.
-   **Application Flow Control:** Routing and Intent-based communication.
-   **Performance and Validity:** Caching and data validation.
-   **The Foundation of the Framework:** Metadata, proxies, and the role of `SimpleApplication`.

Through this journey, you will explore the complex world of framework development and gain a deep understanding of software architecture. Now, let's begin the journey of designing and implementing `Simple-Boot`.
